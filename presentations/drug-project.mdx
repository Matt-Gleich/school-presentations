  Let's start with the basics here. Both Fentanyl and Heroin are opioids which are also known as narcotics.
  Opioids are drugs that are prescribed to treat pain. Fentanyl is still prescribed to patients but Heroin is 100% illegal in the United States.

Fentanyl is a schedule 2 drug which means it has some medical uses but has a high chance of abuse and addiction. Heroin on the other hand is a schedule 1 drug which means it has an extremely high chance of addiction and has no medical uses.

<Notes>Now let's take a more detailed view at Fentanyl</Notes>

<Title>Fentanyl</Title>

---

<Notes>
  Like a lot of opioids, Fentanyl started as a drug to help people going through
  immense pain medically speaking. As some academic papers about the production
  of Fentanyl were coming out on the web drug dealers took these papers and
  started to manufacture them themselves. These drug dealers produced Fentanyl
  under horrible conditions and would even mix it with Heroin for a more potent
  drug.

Timeline:

The first event for Fentanyl was its invention in 1960. It was invented by Paul Janssen who was in Belgium. They ended up creating the most potent opioid had ever seen at the time.

In the early decades of the drug, everything was relatively calm with it being used in the medical field with some opposition over how addictive it _could_ be.

Fentanyl started to become easier to consume with the invention of a patch and a tiny pill in the '90s.

Production became easier for drug dealers as scientific papers became easier to access on the web.

A large amount of usage during the 2010s in northern states such as New Hampshire and Massachusetts. By 2016 the number of ODs (over-doses) from Fentanyl doubled according to the CDC (Centers for Disease Control).
